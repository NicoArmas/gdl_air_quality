## **Graph Neural Network and data building for air quality forecasting**

**SP 2022**
**Group members: Lorenzo Di Tria, Nicola Armas**


This Repo contains GDL 'Air quality' project. 
It is structured as follows:

- _code_ folder: contains our GNN (_graph_model.py_), a Spatial Dilated Convolutional network (_graph_baseline.py_) and a non-graph baseline model (_LSTM_tsl_baseline.py_).
It also contains the main class *airquality.py* and the temporal builder.

	_analysis.ipynb_ jupyter notebook contains all the data analysis performed.
	_model_analysis.ipynb_ contains all the analysis on model performances.


	
- _models\_data_ folder: contains logs and metrics of the trained models.

- _tsl_ submodule: contains the TSL library for quick access. 
		
- _data_ folder: to be downloaded from https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/LVLgP5HbFcuXy8q in order for the project to work.
